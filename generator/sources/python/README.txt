Sep 2015 - support JSON requests, compatible with Kaltura server version 10.20.0 and above. 
Aug 2013 - the library was refactored to make it installable as a PyPI package.
	This refactoring changed the way Kaltura client plugin modules are loaded -
	before the change the metadata plugin (for example) was loaded by:
		from KalturaMetadataClientPlugin import *
	when upgrading the client, this will need to be changed to:
		from KalturaClient.Plugins.Metadata import *
