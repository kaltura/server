# This is the public PHP SDK for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

# Testing, Linting, and Formatting

Run the script `tools/verify.sh` script:

```
./tools/verify.sh
```

We recommend adding this as a pre-commit hook which can be done by running the following command:

```
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

# Codegen

You can run the codegen using:

```
mvn clean install
```

You can run the codegen for a single spec using:

```
mvn clean install --projects codegen/objectstorage
```


# Testing

You can run the unit tests using:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit

By default, the tests for Instance Principals are not run. You can run those using:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --group InstancePrincipalsRequired
```


# Formatting

You can run the source formatter using:

```
tools/php-cs-fixer
```


# Linting

You can run the linter using:

```
vendor/bin/phplint
```

# Static Analysis

You can run PHPstan using:

```
PHPSTAN_PHP=`which php7.3.11` tools/phpstan
```

Note: PHPstan needs to be run with PHP 7 or higher. Set the `PHPSTAN_PHP` environment variable to the location of your PHP 7+ executable.

## Composer

Composer is a package manager for PHP.

[Downloading and Installing Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

```
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === '906a84df04cea2aa72f40b5f787e49f22d4c2f19492ac310e8cba5b96ac8b64115ac402c8cd292b8a03482574915d1a8') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Once you have the OCI PHP SDK checked out, you can install all the vendor packages using:

```
composer update
composer install
```

## PHPUnit

We require [PHPUnit 5.7](https://phpunit.de/manual/5.7/en/installation.html).
