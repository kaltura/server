/**
 * Response object for paged results from a list API method
 *
 * The PagedListResponse object is returned by API methods that implement
 * pagination, and makes it easier to access multiple pages of results
 * without having to manually manipulate page tokens. Pages are retrieved
 * lazily, with additional API calls being made as additional results
 * are required.
 *
 * The list elements can be accessed in the following ways:
 *  - As a single iterable used in a foreach loop or via the getIterator method
 *  - As pages of elements, using the getPage and iteratePages methods
 *  - As fixed size collections of elements, using the
 *    getFixedSizeCollection and iterateFixedSizeCollections methods
 *
 * Example of using PagedListResponse as an iterator:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * foreach ($pagedListResponse as $element) {
 *     // doSomethingWith($element);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example of iterating over each page of elements:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * foreach ($pagedListResponse->iteratePages() as $page) {
 *     foreach ($page as $element) {
 *         // doSomethingWith($element);
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example of accessing the current page, and manually iterating
 * over pages:
 * ```
 * $pagedListResponse = $client->getList(...);
 * $page = $pagedListResponse->getPage();
 * // doSomethingWith($page);
 * while ($page->hasNextPage()) {
 *     $page = $page->getNextPage();
 *     // doSomethingWith($page);
 * }
 * ```
