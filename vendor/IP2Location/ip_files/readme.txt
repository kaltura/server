 What this database is
 =====================

 This Database is operated and maintained by Webnet77 and updated every 24
 hours. It represents [almost] all 2 billion [approximately] IPV4 numbers in
 use on the internet today and includes the IANA reserved IPs.

 This Database is automatically reconstituted every 24 hours by special
 software running on our servers. The bottom of the main page shows how long ago
 it was updated as well as giving an the exact time of the next update.

 TIP: During updates, the database is unavailable for about 5 minutes. We
      recommend you **do not** download this database 5 minutes before or after
      the scheduled update window to avoid the possibility of downloading a
      blank file.

 IP FROM      IP TO        REGISTRY  ASSIGNED   CTRY CNTRY COUNTRY
 "1346797568","1346801663","ripencc","20010601","IL","ISR","ISRAEL"

 IP FROM   : Numerical representation of IP address.
             Example: (from Right to Left)
             1.2.3.4 = 4 + (3 * 256) + (2 * 256 * 256) + (1 * 256 * 256 * 256)
             is 4 + 768 + 13,1072 + 16,777,216 = 16,909,060

 REGISTRY  : apcnic, arin, lacnic, ripencc and afrinic
             Also included as of April 22, 2005 are the IANA IETF Reserved
             address numbers. These are important since any source claiming
             to be from one of these IPs must be spoofed.

 ASSIGNED  : The date this IP or block was assigned. (In Epoch seconds)
             NOTE: Where the allocation or assignment has been transferred from
                   one registry to another, the date represents the date of first
                   assignment or allocation as received in from the original RIR.
                   It is noted that where records do not show a date of first
                   assignment, the date is given as "0".

 CTRY      : 2 character international country code
             NOTE: ISO 3166 2-letter code of the organisation to which the
             allocation or assignment was made, and the enumerated variances of:
	          AP - non-specific Asia-Pacific location
	          CS - Serbia and Montenegro (Formally Czechoslovakia)
	          YU - Serbia and Montenegro (Formally Yugoslavia) (Being phased out)
	          EU - non-specific European Union location
	          FX - France, Metropolitan
	          PS - Palestinian Territory, Occupied
	          UK - United Kingdom (standard says GB)
	        * ZZ - IETF RESERVED address space.

             These values are not defined in ISO 3166 but are widely used.
           * IANA Reserved Address space

 CNTRY     : Country Abbreviation. Usually 3 Character representation

 COUNTRY   : Country Name. Full Country Name.

 Countries falling under AFRINIC now show correctly (June 27, 2005)
