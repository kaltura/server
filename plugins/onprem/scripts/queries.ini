; This ini file defines all the queries that are executed and send for usage tracking
; All the queries are executed on the data warehouse database

; queries[] lists the queries that are executed, the report is automatically constructed
; from parameters whose names are the column names of the query (except for array queries, see below)
query[] = "SELECT count(partner_id) as publishers FROM dwh_dim_partners"
query[] = "SELECT count(kuser_id) as pusers FROM dwh_dim_kusers"
query[] = "SELECT sum(count_loads) as player_loads, sum(count_plays) as plays FROM dwh_aggr_partner"
query[] = "SELECT sum(count_storage)/1024 as storage_gb, sum(count_bandwidth)/1024/1024 as bandwidth_gb FROM dwh_aggr_partner"
query[] = "SELECT entry_media_type_id, entry_status_id, count(entry_id) as count FROM dwh_dim_entries GROUP BY entry_media_type_id, entry_status_id"

; array_name[] defines the name of the http post parameter in which to encapsulate the query result (in an array)
; each array_name[] is mapped to the corresponding query[] according the order
; if the array_name is empty, it means that the query expects only one row and thus each column is sent on his own parameter (defined by the column name)
; if the array_name is not empty, it means that the query expects more than one row and thus a parameter with the given array_name is added 
; which encapsulates an array of arrays (list of rows) of values
